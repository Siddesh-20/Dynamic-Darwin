# Inverse Kinematics 

Inverse Kinematics is basically finding the parameters for a bot (angles,joint movements,etc.) so that it can reach a specific point. There are various ways to do it. 
For this assignment, find the angles using trigonometry formulas with the arm length staying constant.  

##### What you need to do:-

	1. Construct a 2-link robot arm on MATLAB.
	2. Plot a Circle.
	3. Make the arm trace the circle.
  
##### Guidelines:-
	
	1. Get acquainted with the basic operations of MATLAB on MATLAB OnRamp Tutorial - https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html
	2. Look up the concept of Inverse Kinematics - https://robotacademy.net.au/lesson/inverse-kinematics-for-a-2-joint-robot-arm-using-geometry/
	3. Don't use any pre-built model for IK. Make your own from scratch.

Note - Take a look at 'Example' video to get a sense of what you need to do.
